# Python Serial Monitor

This is a Serial Monitor written in Python. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This program by itself is not very different from many other serial monitor programs. It has been intentionally kept simple with a very open (MIT) license so that it can be taken apart and reused in other applications.

## Installing

1. Clone the Repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/volunteerlabs/PythonSerialMonitor.git

```

2. You may need wx widgets for python. To get this on Ubuntu use this:


```
apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8

```
Or folow the directions here: https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython

3. To run the code you simply use:

```
python pythonSerialMonitor.py 

```

4. Since this program accesses COM ports you may increased privlidges to use this program. In Ubuntu you can create new rules for a specific device (recommended) or run as admin (not recommended).
