# Python Serial Debug Monitor

This is a Serial Monitor written in Python.

This program by itself is not very different from many other serial monitor programs. It has been intentionally kept simple with a very open (MIT) license so that it can be taken apart and reused in other applications.

<!-- A .wxg file is also included in this repository which can be loaded and modified using WxGlade a very simple python GUI builder for WxPython. -->
